       <p>Onlineforu LTD, was formed just over 5 years ago, I started the business when I started university. I needed work while studying but having a full time job was not an option. We did as to still do, take any job that came our way. At the time the jobs we got were helping e-commerce companies selling on sites like Amazon and eBay, to get improve their sales.</p>

       <p>Althogh we still do some some of that, our main foucus is on developing and hosting websites and building applications.</p>
